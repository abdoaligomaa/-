// we use templete string to make the code more dynamic and easier
// look at the two example in below 

let myName = 'abdo ali'
let age = 21
console.log('my name is' + myName + ' and my age is ' + age) // the first example 
console.log(`my name is ${myName} and my age is ${age}`) // the second example
    // the two exampes will give the same result .
